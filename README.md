# Visual Question Asnwering

Implementation for a Kaggle challenge organized by the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at Politecnico di Milano.

Given an image from a synthetic dataset and a question, the goal is to provide the correct answer belonging to 3 possible categories: 'yes/no', 'counting' (from 0 to 5) and 'other' (e.g. colors, location, ecc.) answers.
